# SheetShell
## An experimental shell design

### Design principles

_to be articulated, but it all started out because [Dan Hon](https://twitter.com/hondanhon) said something about spreadsheets in one of his newsletters, and I couldn't help start to wonder: what if all of a computer's primary interactions looked like a spreadsheet?_

### Running

1. Install Go v1.19+
1. Install modules
1. Start shell˘ with `go run .`

### Functionality

#### Env vars
- See a list of your local env vars
- Select a cell to copy the contents to your clipboard

˘What would it take for this to technically be considered a shell?
